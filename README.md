# Subsistence Save Manager
A easy to use save manager for the game Subsistence

# How to install
There are two ways to get this program, you can either compile it yourself, or download a release version.

In order to compile it you must have Visual Studio 2019, .NET Framework 4.7.2.
You can download a release version here: https://github.com/vExo307/subsistence-save-manager/releases

I will not provide support if you would like to compile it yourself, only do it if you know what your doing!

Once you open the application for the first time, it will automatically create the folders, and config you need. It creates it's folders/configs in your 'appdata/roaming' folder, under the folder name 'SubSaveManager'. It is not recomeneded that you edit this information if you do not know what you are doing.

It will also try to automatically find your Subsistence folder under the directory 'C:/Program Files/Steam/steamapps/common/Subsistence', if it cannot find this directory it will prompt you to select you Subsistence folder.
